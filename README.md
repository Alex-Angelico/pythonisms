## Using Dunder Methods, Decorators, Iterators, and Generators

Lab 42 - Pythonisms

Author: Alex Angelico

## Findings

In exploring ways to test the various Pythonisms introduced for this lab, I found I was able to do some very useful things to enhance both the computation and presentational qualities of my code. First and foremost, I was able to write a generator that programmatically builds strings of alphabetical gibberish with an optional uniform hash target. This is a powerful tool testing data structures such as a hash table, as it allows them to be populated with data quickly.

Similarly, with the help of dunders, iterators, and decorators, I managed to create methods for clearly visually representing data in a hash table and its constituent linked lists. This has given me a better understanding of how those data strucutres work, and of their possible utilities.
